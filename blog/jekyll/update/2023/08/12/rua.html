    <p>A graph is a primitive representation of relationships between entities, and it allows for a profound and direct understanding of the associations in the world. Typical applications of graph data include social networks, transaction data, knowledge graphs, transportation systems, biotechnology, and etcetera.Social networks are a specific type of graph data which is built upon the foundation of graph networks and guided by certain sociological theories.</p>

<p>Graph Analysis focuses on analyzing the strength and direction of relationships between entities in graph data, thereby uncovering features and assisting in decision-making.</p>

<p>EasyGraph is an open-source graph analysis package based on the Python language, developed by the MSN team at Fudan University. <strong>Compared to existing open-source libraries focusing on graph analysis such as igraph and NetworkX, EasyGraph offers a more comprehensive set of social network analysis methods grounded in sociological theories.</strong> Its main functionalities include the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>The first open-source library that includes a comprehensive set of structural hole spanner detection methods (for more understanding of the structural hole theory: [Structural Hole Theory in Social Network Analysis: A Review</td>
          <td>IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine</td>
          <td>IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9406195))</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Graph embedding algorithms like DeepWalk, Node2Vec, LINE, SDNE, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Classic network algorithms for community detection, centrality analysis, component analysis, clustering, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved runtime efficiency through hybrid programming and parallel computing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A collection of visualization methods for complex networks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Including various classic datasets.</p>

    <p>With this architecture, EasyGraph can be applied in various domains such as biology, transportation, chemistry, social sciences, ecology, and more for graph data analysis.</p>
