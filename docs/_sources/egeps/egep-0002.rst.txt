Proposal to improve collaborative doc updating workflow
======================================================

Introduction
------------
Teddy is proposing a workflow change to improve collaborative doc updating for the EasyGraph project. The goal is to establish a single source of truth for all documentation, and to minimize merge conflicts and overwritten work.

Proposal
--------

Teddy suggests using the following workflow for editing and updating documentation:

1. Use the repo at https://github.com/easy-graph/easygraph-doc-source as
   the single source of truth when editing rst, building HTML files or
   add images.
2. Teddy has added write access to this repo for all team members.
3. Avoid directly pushing your own eg doc source repo generated HTML to
   https://github.com/easy-graph/easy-graph.github.io as this often
   results in merge conflicts or overwriting others work.

Conclusion
----------

Teddy's proposal aims to improve the collaborative doc updating workflow for the EasyGraph project by establishing a single source of truth for all documentation. By following this workflow, team members can work together more efficiently, and avoid merge conflicts and overwritten work.
