
Installation
============

For users of Windows, MacOSX, and Linux, we recommend using Python's 
package management system, `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable>`_ .
EasyGraph's site on PyPI - `Link <https://pypi.org/project/Python-EasyGraph/>`_

**Installation with** ``pip``
::

    $ pip install Python-EasyGraph

The conda package is no longer updated or maintained.
If you've installed easygraph this way before, please uninstall it with conda and install it with pip.
If prebuilt easygraph wheels are not supported for your platform (OS / CPU arch, check here), you can build it locally this way:

**Example installation with** ``conda``
::
    $ git clone https://github.com/easy-graph/Easy-Graph && cd Easy-Graph && git checkout pybind11
    $ pip install pybind11
    $ python3 setup.py build_ext
    $ python3 setup.py install

.. hint::
    EasyGraph uses  1.12.1 <= `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_ < 2.0 for machine
    learning functions.
    Note that this does not prevent your from running non-machine learning functions normally,
    if there is no PyTorch in your environment.
    But you will receive some warnings which remind you some unavailable modules when they depend on it.
