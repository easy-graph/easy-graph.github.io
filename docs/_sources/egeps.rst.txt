EasyGraph Enhancement Proposals
================================

For now, EasyGraph has implemented graph computation functions, 
including fundamental methods, for example, connected/biconnected components, 
community detection, PageRank; as well as advanced methods, for example, 
structure hole spanners detection, graph embedding. All of these functions 
are implemented with Python language in EasyGraph, even if the original authors 
of some graph computing methods are using different language, C and C++, for instance. 

With the help of EasyGraph, users can easily try and compare different graph computation 
methods in the same platform.
