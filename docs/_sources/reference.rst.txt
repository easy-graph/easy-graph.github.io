EasyGraph API
=========

At this point, EasyGraph has integrated a variety of graph computation functions, 
including fundamental methods such as connected and biconnected components, community detection, 
and PageRank, as well as advanced methods like structural hole spanners detection 
and graph embedding. Despite that some graph computing methods were originally 
implemented with other languages such as C and C++, all these functionalities 
are now encapsulated within EasyGraph and implemented using Python.




EasyGraph enables users to easily experiment with and compare different graph 
computation methods within the same platform.
